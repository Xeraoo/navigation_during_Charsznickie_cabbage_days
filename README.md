## Introduction
The aim of this project was to create an application using ESRI Field Maps software to inventory objects that aid navigation during the regional event "Charsznickie Cabbage Days 2023." The application supports navigation around the event site, providing visitors with precise information about locations and descriptions of key points, such as parking lots, recreational areas, the main stage, and other important places.


## Charsznickie Cabbage Days
Charsznickie Cabbage Days is an annual celebration held in the Charsznica municipality, aiming to promote cabbage as a significant element of local culture and tradition. The event attracts both residents and tourists, offering a variety of attractions, such as cabbage cultivation presentations and competitions, agricultural machinery exhibitions, and the selection of the Cabbage Royal Couple.

During the event, visitors can sample local cabbage-based dishes, such as stuffed cabbage rolls, bigos, and cabbage soup. Charsznickie Cabbage Days also feature artistic performances, concerts, and fireworks, highlighting the importance of this event for the region.

## Application Objectives
The application, developed based on ESRI Field Maps, provides information about attractions and locations available during the event. The layers in the app allow visitors to explore places such as landmarks, dining spots, entertainment areas, and functional facilities. Layers were created manually based on base maps and municipal boundaries obtained from the geoportal.

## Layer Creation Process
The layer creation process began with adding the Open Street Map base map and municipal boundaries from the geoportal. Layers were created to include detailed information about field objects to assist with navigation around the Charsznica area.

## Data Collection Process
The data collection process consisted of two stages:
1. Collecting data on the central area of Charsznica, where the event is held.
2. Gathering data on fields in the northern part of the municipality, mainly for agricultural production.

The data included locations, types of crops, plot sizes, and other essential information. The collected data enabled an accurate representation of the areas associated with the event.
